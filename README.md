## Overview

This project is a deep learning-powered web app that recognizes handwritten digits in real time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

## How It Works

### ‚ú® Model Training

- Built with TensorFlow and Keras using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- The model architecture includes:
  - **Conv2D:** Extracts spatial features from images.
  - **BatchNormalization:** Stabilizes and speeds up training.
  - **MaxPooling2D:** Reduces spatial dimensions, focusing on important features.
  - **Dense:** Fully connected layers for classification.
  - **Dropout:** Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
- Achieved over 99% accuracy on test data!
- Trained model is saved in `.keras` format for easy deployment.

### üñ•Ô∏è Interactive GUI

- Developed with Streamlit and `streamlit-drawable-canvas`.
- Users can draw any digit (0-9) on the canvas and click "Recognize" for instant predictions.
- The app preprocesses your drawing, feeds it to the trained CNN, and displays the predicted digit with confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build

### 1. Train the Model

- Run `train_digit_recognizer.py` to train and save the CNN model.

### 2. Run the App

- Launch `gui_digit_recognizer.py` with Streamlit:
  ```bash
  streamlit run gui_digit_recognizer.py
  ```
- All dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt` (Python packages) and `packages.txt` (system packages for deployment).
